Remi Pearson - How we get 97%+ retention
---

### ```PRESENTER-ONLY``` [1]

### My business thanks to PLF [2]

- I own and run a company I started 18 years ago: TCI, The Coaching Institute [3]
  - We are based in Northern Australia [4]
- In the podcast I did with Jeff a few weeks ago, we geeked out on PLF [5]
- I have bought PLF in the very first launch [6]
- And afterwards, I kept buying PLF at full price every single year to say Â« Thank you Â» (instead of getting the discounted-price upgrade) [7]
- Itâ€™s a small price to pay for the hundreds of millions of dollars PLF has given me [8]

### The Product Launch Formula has changed my whole business [9]

- I used to be in the first Platinum Mastermind, but never attended the meetings [10]
- I run my business using the Heroâ€™s Journey and Product Launch Formula [11]
- We are the industry leader in Australia and Asia by a large amount [12]
- Weâ€™ve done 8-figures for 13 years, where most competitors struggle in the $1-$2M zone [13]

### All our communication is based on PLF with some additions ```PRESENTER-ONLY``` [14]

### PLF: from launching to stick rate [15]

- All our communication is based on PLF with some additions [16]
  - We have a pre-launch, and pre-pre, and pre-pre-pre, and pre-pre-pre-pre-launch [17]
- Today our topic will be mostly our retention (stick rate) [18]
  - We have 97%+ month-over-month retention of our members in 99 countries [19]
  - Our LTV (lifetime value) is over 5 years [20]
  - By contrast, most memberships keep people from 3 months to a couple years [21]

### The programs our students join [22]

- The membership offers we make are usually 12-months to 3-years [23]
- Members then join a Masterâ€™s Academy, or become lifelong members [24]
  - So they keep paying even after their original membership is over [25]
- 30% of people stay on after the end of the membership. [26]
- We see retention in four stages : [27]
  - Pay [28]
  - Play [29]
  - Stay [30]
  - Upgrade [31]
